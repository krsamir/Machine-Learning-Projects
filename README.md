### Covid-19 Data Analysis (For India Only)
On executing the `Covid-19 Data Analysis.ipynb` file, automatically `web_script.py` script executes and scraps covid-19 data from `mohfw.gov.in `website. This file produces `output.csv` which is further cleaned and a csv file named `clean_output.csv` is prepared which is used for analysis.<br>
`Indian Coordinates.csv` has also been used for `Folium` Maps.<br>
